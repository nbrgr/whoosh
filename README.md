# whoosh
WhooSH, the Whoo Shell project for CS537 at UW Madison

## Why is this online?

This is online to serve as an example of code that I have previously written.

## Is it okay to use this code?

If you're currently a student at UW Madison and working on the same project, using any piece of this code could be considered academic dishonesty. I would recommend against it.
